# What is it about?

The [uutils project](https://github.com/uutils/) is aiming at rewriting key Linux utilities in Rust, targeting [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), [findutils](https://github.com/uutils/findutils), [diffutils](https://github.com/uutils/diffutils), [procps](https://github.com/uutils/procps), [util-linux](https://github.com/uutils/util-linux), and [bsdutils](https://github.com/uutils/bsdutils). Their goal is to create fully compatible, high-performance drop-in replacements, ensuring reliability through upstream test suites. Significant progress has been made with coreutils, diffutils, and findutils, while the other utilities are in the early stages of development.

# How to get started

Here are some steps to follow if you want to apply for a GSOC project
with uutils.

1. **Check the requirements.** You have to meet
  [Google's requirements](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) to apply. Specifically for uutils, it's best if you at
  least know some Rust and have some familiarity with using the
  coreutils and the other tools.
1. **Reach out to us!** We are happy to discuss potential projects and help you find a meaningful project for uutils. Tell us what interests you about the project and what experience you have and we can find a suitable project together. You can talk to the uutils maintainers on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wQVJbvJ). In particular, you can contact:
    * Sylvestre Ledru (@sylvestre on GitHub and Discord)
    * Terts Diepraam (@tertsdiepraam on GitHub and @terts on Discord)
2. **Get comfortable with uutils.** To find a good project you need to understand the codebase. We recommend that you take a look at the code, the issue tracker and maybe try to tackle some [good-first-issues](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Also take a look at our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. **Find a project and a mentor.** We have a [list of potential projects](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/wiki/GSOC-Project-Ideas) you can adapt or use as inspiration. Make sure discuss your ideas with the maintainers! Some project ideas below have suggested mentors you could contact.
4. **Write the application.** You can do this with your mentor. The application has to go through Google, so make sure to follow all the advice in Google's [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal). Please make sure you include your prior contributions to uutils in your application.

# Tips

## Complete the `mv` GNU compatibility

Most of the features in `mv` have been implemented by now.
However, some corner cases needs to be implemented. We have 10 remaining failing tests.

To get the list of failing tests, run:
```bash
$ ./util/remaining-gnu-error.py | grep "/mv/"
```

- Difficulty: Medium
- Size: 175

## Improve `stty`
The `stty` utility is currently only partially implemented and should be expanded.

See issues: [#3859](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3859), [#3860](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3860), [#3861](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3861), [#3862](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3862), [#3863](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3863).

- Mentors: Terts Diepraam
- Required skills:
  - Rust
  - Basic knowledge about the terminal

## Improve findutils coverage

[More than half](https://github.com/uutils/findutils-tracking/) of the findutils GNU & BFS are passing. The goal of this project is to improve the compatibility of uutils/findutils with regard to GNU's implementation.

See [https://github.com/uutils/findutils](https://github.com/uutils/findutils)


To achieve this, we should invest in fuzzing findutils:
Just like we are [doing with some](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/tree/main/fuzz/fuzz_targets) [Coreutils programs](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/blob/main/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml), we should:
* fuzz findutils
* do some differential testing with GNU's implementation (and potentially others)

- Difficulty: Medium
- Size: 175
- Mentors: Sylvestre
- Required skills:
  - Rust
  - Basic knowledge about the terminal usage

## Localization
Support for localization for formatting, quoting & sorting in various utilities, like `date`, `ls` and `sort`. For this project, we need to figure out how to deal with locale data. The first option is to use the all-Rust `icu4x` library, which has a different format than what distributions usually provide. In this case a solution _could_ be to write a custom `localedef`-like command. The second option is to use a wrapper around the C `icu` library, which comes with the downside of being a C dependency.

This is described in detail in [issue #3997](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3997).

And was also discussed in [#1919](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/1919#issuecomment-846471073), [#3584](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/3584).

## Symbolic/Fuzz Testing and Formal Verification of Tool Grammars

See [Using Lightweight Formal Methods to Validate a Key Value Storage Node In Amazon S3](https://www.amazon.science/publications/using-lightweight-formal-methods-to-validate-a-key-value-storage-node-in-amazon-s3).

Most KLEE scaffolding was done for [KLEE 2021](https://project-oak.github.io/rust-verification-tools/2021/07/14/coreutils.html).

Start with `wc`, formalize the command line grammar. Get it working under AFL++ and Klee. Add several proofs of resource use and correctness - especially proofs about operating system calls and memory/cache usage. Generalize to other tools. Try to unify the seeds for the fuzzer and KLEE so they can help each other find new paths. Use QEMU to test several operating systems and architectures. Automate detection of performance regressions - try to hunt for [accidentally quadratic](https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com) behavior.

Specific to `wc` - formalize the inner loop over a UTF-8 buffer into a finite state automata with counters that can generalize into SIMD width operations like [simdjson](https://simdjson.org). Further generalize into a monoid so K processors can combine results.

- Difficulty: Mixed
- Size: Mixed
- Mentors: TBD  - informally @chadbrewbaker
- Required skills:
  - Rust
  - KLEE
  - Fuzzers like AFL++
  - Grammar testing frameworks like [LARK](https://github.com/ligurio/lark-grammars/tree/master/lark_grammars/grammars)
  - /usr/bin/time -v (and similar tools for Widows/OSX).
  - Alloy, TLA+, [P](https://github.com/p-org/P)
  - System call tracing with [strace](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/17/spying-on-ssh-with-strace/), [uftrace](https://github.com/namhyung/uftrace) etc.
  - SMT solvers like [Z3](https://www.philipzucker.com/programming-and-interactive-proving-with-z3py/) and CVC5 for superoptimization and proofs of automata equivalence.
  - [SOUPER](https://github.com/google/souper) and [CompilerExplorer](https://godbolt.org)
  - Basic statistics on quantiles (histograms) for outlier detection. The math is simple as generalizing from one to k medians but the formal notation is [complex](https://aakinshin.net/posts/thdqe-hdi/).
  - [MPI-IO](https://wgropp.cs.illinois.edu/courses/cs598-s16/lectures/lecture32.pdf), just enough to read a file into k parts and combine "wc" outputs to understand multicore scaling.

## Development of advanced terminal session recording and replay tools in Rust

This project involves creating Rust-based implementations of `/usr/bin/script`, `/usr/bin/scriptlive`, and `/usr/bin/scriptreplay`. The `/usr/bin/script` command will record terminal sessions, `/usr/bin/scriptlive` will offer real-time recording features, and `/usr/bin/scriptreplay` will be used to replay recorded sessions.

The work will happen in https://github.com/uutils/bsdutils.

- **Description:**:  Develop Rust-based versions of `/usr/bin/script`, `/usr/bin/scriptlive`, and `/usr/bin/scriptreplay` for terminal session recording and replaying.
- **Expected Outputs:**:  Robust and cross-platform terminal session recording and replay tools, with real-time features in `scriptlive`.

## Official Redox support</h2>
We want to support the Redox operating system, but are not actively testing against it. Since the last round of fixes in [#2550](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/2550), many changes have probably been introduced that break Redox support. This project would involve setting up Redox in the CI and fixing any issues that arise and porting features over.
